# LiteLIS

LiteLIS is a Python-based desktop application built using tkinter and MySQL. The app provides laboratory scientists with a user-friendly interface to enter and store the results of Liver Function Tests (LFT) and Renal Function Tests (RFT) for patients. The data is securely stored in a MySQL database, allowing for easy retrieval and review at a later time. Additionally, the app offers the convenience of generating neatly formatted lab reports for better record-keeping and analysis.
This project is a result of a problem I identified in rural clinics in my community.

## Key Features

- Simple and intuitive GUI for entering patient details, LFT, and RFT values.
- Data is securely stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and management.
- Lab reports are generated in a well-structured format for easy review and documentation.
- Error handling and data validation ensure accurate and reliable results.
- Easy-to-use interface suitable for laboratory scientists and medical professionals.

**Note**: For safety and security reasons, sensitive patient information is not stored or processed within the application. The focus is solely on managing lab test results for professional use within a controlled environment.

Enjoy using the LiteLIS to streamline your lab operations and improve patient care! Contributions and feedback are warmly welcome.
